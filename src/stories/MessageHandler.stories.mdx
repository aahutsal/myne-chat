# Message Handlers 

Although we can send messages to our nodes via their REST API, to listen to the messages
sent to them, we need to use a messaage handler. From a technical perspective, this means
attaching an `EventHandler` to our WebSocket server using a client with the right URL and
API token (assuming your HOPR server uses one).

For MyneChat, we use the web `WebSocket` implementation and provide this handler to a global
scope using the `useWebSocket` React Hook.

## Demo (mocks only)

The following shows how to create a handler via using our mocks server, which showcases how we can
connect to a HOPRd client. First, our mocks server will send messages to it our WebSocket
mock server, which we have subscribed to via a component WebSocket handler which we have
in our application. Every HOPR application needs to connect to the WebSocket server the
HOPRd instance spins up.

The following component creates an handler which connects to the WebSocket endpoint from our mocks.
Update it to the URL of your WebSocket endpoint (only update if your mocks server is running in a
different port or URL). Then, try to send a message clicking the "Random Msg" button.

If you saw a message like `The default transformer is ...`, it means that our component WebSocket
handler was able to receive the message sent to the WebSocket server. In this case we sent the
message ourselves, but for normal HOPR applications, this is sent via another HOPR node when a
successful relay happens.

The transformer is an example on how one could create a variation of a chat. Although this is not
supported here directly in the demo (the `Function` is created on load and canâ€™t be updated since
we are using `eval` to showcase it), you can see the code in the `mocks-demo` and `mocks-handler`
components to give you an idea how this could be done.
